# SGLang Benchmark Status

This folder is the standalone, human-readable entry point for Cachet SGLang
benchmark status. There is not yet a published live SGLang latency or quality
benchmark result.

## Current Status

| Status | Databricks run | Source artifacts | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pending latency and quality benchmark | Not available yet | Not available yet | A live SGLang endpoint still needs to validate decode-time prefix binding with Cachet handoffs before Cachet can publish SGLang latency, throughput, or quality numbers. |
| Native HiCache integration evidence | `934698284395881` | [`../databricks/2026-06-23-g6-l4-native-engine-probes/`](../databricks/2026-06-23-g6-l4-native-engine-probes/) | Provider-backed native probe and connector-action records succeeded on AWS g6/L4, but these records are integration evidence, not benchmark measurements. |

## Live Smoke Helper

`document_kv_cache.sglang_smoke` and
`document_kv_cache.databricks_sglang_smoke_job` now provide the strict live
SGLang readiness path. The smoke launches pinned SGLang with Cachet's dynamic
HiCache provider config, validates the provider factory, runs a full-prompt
baseline, then runs a Cachet handoff-backed cache arm with suffix-only runtime
prompt text and `kv_transfer_params` under SGLang `custom_params`.

Those helpers are a submission path, not a result. This report remains pending
until a Databricks g6/L4 or g5/A10G run writes `sglang-live-smoke.json` with a
passing baseline and cache arm.

## Benchmark Gate

Treat SGLang benchmark publication as pending until all of these are true:

- A real SGLang serving endpoint is launched on the target Databricks hardware.
- The endpoint receives Cachet `kv_transfer_params` from a generated handoff.
- Decode-time prefix binding is validated against the live endpoint.
- Latency, throughput, and quality measurements are recorded with the same
  benchmark schema used by the vLLM report.

## Evidence Boundary

The native probe source records under `../databricks/` prove that Cachet can
wire provider-backed dynamic HiCache integration in the target runtime. They
must not be cited as SGLang latency, throughput, or quality benchmark results.
Do not use `../../pr-evidence/` as the benchmark report surface.
